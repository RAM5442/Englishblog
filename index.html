*So,This an weblog by me A.RAM.0
*I have started this today (TUSEDAY,23/09/2025).
*Lets hope i will maintain this if i can.
*So its about how i created this weblog or aka blog.
*Its basic html css code being edit on vs code editor,
 and being updated and pusblished on git hub.
*Well the git hub can only support static web applications like this,
 and doesn't support dynamic web applications.
*Well what's a static web app and what's a dynamic web app?
*Its can be just simply put like this that is, a static web app is something you
 can only see something like a blog or download something like a picture or a video.
*While a dynamic one is a web app in that you can you can upload or download a picture
 or a video.
*A bit nerdy you feel about me, i can feel already but i have to make a blog of
 something right so i decided to make a note of how i created my first assignment 
 thats all.

*Hey,This is day 2 of bloging my daily routine.8
*So, Today we have submitted our Laboratory manual for correction.
*I find it ammusing to do everything ourselves from experimenting with the chemicals
 to filling all the manual with our own reading and we have to punch the stamp that
 the teacher's will be providing us, well let alone punching the stamp on our own
 my school didn't even had a stamp in the laboratory even for a formality ðŸ˜¤.

*So..,We planned a IV(Industrial Visit) to CECRI, KARUR.
*Well they planned it for knowledge prupose but i have a feeling of it being a college
 tour.
*Well there was certainly many attractive innovations but there was also many "sights"
 to see.
*Me any my group of three had a good time there with the "sights".
*Today's trip to karur was very good but i didn't feel the traveling pain at all, so
 todays trip was smooth.

         <pre class="cont">
*Today i woke up at 11:20am, wuff it long sleep after a more than 30 days of less 
 hours of sleep, because of 3 idiots "Presanth,Nishanth,Mahadhevan".
*Today all i did was to play TDM (Team Death Match) from BGMI.
*Our hosteler RAVISH has caused a mesh it seems like the didn't eat dinner properly
 due to the lack of quality in the food from the messhall for 3 days and he threw a
 tandrum to the servents and it seems like a problem but what they did is also not
 right as they can provide food of better quality as we hostelers have wittnessed it.
 And there was a fuss and notning was done and our warderns are on a leave let's see
 what happens tomorrow Ravish has started it and we are gonna end it if they thought
 of trying something funny.
